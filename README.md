Situation: I was tasked with developing a dashboard that provides a comprehensive analysis of the Brazilian labor market between 2020 and 2024. The primary objective was to offer a clear and detailed view of admissions, dismissals, and salary variations by region, state, and economic sector, as well as allow comparisons over time.

Task: My responsibility was to build an interactive dashboard using Power BI to organize and visualize the data in an intuitive way. This included creating charts that allow users to explore different data dimensions, such as salary evolution, labor movement balance, and regional and sectoral comparisons.

Action: By collecting data from reliable sources, such as Novo Caged â€“ MTE, I structured the dashboard with the following key features:

Admissions and Dismissals: I developed charts that show the total number of admissions and dismissals by region, state, and municipality, highlighting the areas with the highest worker turnover.

Salary Evolution: I created a line chart to visualize the evolution of average salaries for admissions and dismissals over time.

Sectoral Economic Analysis: I organized a bar chart detailing the distribution of admissions and dismissals across economic sectors like services, commerce, industry, and agriculture.

Interactivity: I added filters to allow users to select different months and years, providing customizable temporal analysis and making it easier to view the net balance of labor movements by sector and region.

Result: As a result, the dashboard I developed is a powerful and visually attractive tool that can help managers and analysts understand trends in the Brazilian labor market. It provides valuable insights by allowing users to quickly identify patterns in admissions, dismissals, and salary movements, all in an interactive and accessible way.
